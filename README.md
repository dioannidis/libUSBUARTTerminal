## libUSBUARTTerminal

  The libUSBUARTTerminal is a uart client for the USBasp firmware with uart support made by the user [akrasuski1](https://github.com/akrasuski1) on his github [repository](https://github.com/akrasuski1/usbasp-uart).
  
  It is written in [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/) and [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) and while the main development is hosted at [my private scm server](https://scm.nephelae.eu/Nephelae/libUSBUARTTerminal/wiki), a mirror repository created at this github [repository](https://github.com/dioannidis/libUSBUARTTerminal).
  
  It's still in Alpha version, just because there isn't too much free time .... :(
